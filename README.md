Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic use of engineering ideas, methods, and tools to create and maintain high-quality software systems. Software engineering plays an important part in the technology business by enabling the production of software applications and systems that power different elements of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The establishment of software engineering as a disipline in 1960, development of programming languages, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requrements- gathering informations about the user needs and the system requirements. Design- creating high quality designs of the software architecture and user interface. Implementation -Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. Testing- conducting tests to ensure that the software meets the quality standards and requirements. Deployment - realising the software to customers. Maintance- providing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methadology is a sequential approach with distinct  phases and agile incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- writes code and implement software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer- ensures software quality by executing tests plans and by designing.
Project manager- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code and VCS  track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines and requirement changes. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit- testing modules of software
Integration- testing interactions between different substations
System - testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance- testing the system against user requirements to see if it meets them.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Crafting statements or questions in order to get the best answers from AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt- describe a phone. Improved prompt could be describe a Samsung S25 and its system specification.
